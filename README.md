## mlp-uoi-coursework
Exercise for neural networks course at [cse-uoi](http://www.cs.uoi.gr/), winter 2019.


Multilayer-Perceptron implementation and training, written in Java.

In this project we used clean Java (without any external libraries)
to create a Multilayer\-Perceptron Neural Network with two hidden layers.

* `MLP2019/src/MultiLayerPerceptron.java` contains `main` and the implementation of the training algorithms. 
The other classes just help on data management.

* `Plot.java` showcases training results.
